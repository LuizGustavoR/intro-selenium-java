# intro-selenium-java

I've created this repository with the objective to learn about web test automation projects using:
- Java, Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Maven and Docker.

# Setup Instructions

## Your Computer Setup

Previous software to be installed on your computer.
- Java 19.
- Maven.
- IDE (Preferred Intellij).
- Docker Desktop.

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal and go to the project root folder.
3. Run `mvn test`.

PS: Check if your maven is using the jdk-19 (mvn --version).\
PS2: Check is the browser version of your machine\
is the same version of the chromedriver inside the project /resources.

## Allure Reports

After running `mvn test` you have two options to create the report.

1. Run `mvn allure:serve`.\
   The report will be generated into the temp folder\
   where a webserver with the results will start.\
   The webserver has a default timeout of 1 hour.

2. Run `mvn allure:report`.\
   Report will be generated t–æ directory: `target/site/allure-maven/index.html`

---

## Docker Setup

Scale tests using docker.\
(selenium/hub, selenium/node-chrome, selenium/node-firefox).

1. Open the terminal and go to your project root folder.
2. Choose the `docker-compose` directory accordingly to the architecture your docker containers will be run.
   1. If architecture `x86-64` go to folder: `cd /docker/intel-amd/`
   2. If architecture `arm64` go to folder: `cd /docker/arm64/`
3. Run the command below to spin up the nodes:\
   `docker-compose up -d`
4. Go back to the project root folder\
   `intro-selenium-java/`\
   and run the maven tests:\
   `mvn test -Dtest.remote=true`
5. To shut down the docker nodes\
   go back inside your specific docker folder\
   `cd /docker/intel-amd/` or `cd /docker/arm64/`\
   and shut down the nodes with the command\
   `docker-compose down`.

PS: The `docker pull` command is not needed.\
If you haven't pulled the images yet,\
docker will do it for you while spinning up the images.
